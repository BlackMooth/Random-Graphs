# Random-Graphs
This little algorithmic project is centered in connectivity study applied in Random Graphs, more specifically: Erdos-Renyi model and Random Geometric one. Our code reproduces behaviour of both: 
Binomial model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model)  
Random-Geometric model (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_geometric_graph)
Code is designed to generate statistics about connected components from the generated graphs with statistic purpose (the main aim is determining phase transition, if it exists, in both graphs models). 
Here there is a full description of demanded work: 
And here we have our results after doing appropiate analysis of data obtained with the mentioned experiments:
